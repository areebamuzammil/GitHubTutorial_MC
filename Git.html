        <h3>Step-1: Create GitHub Account</h3>
        <p>First we need to create our GitHub account. For this Click <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">here</a></p>

    <div>
        <h3>Step-2: Create a new Repository on GitHub</h3>
        <p>To create a new repository on GitHub, log in and click on "+" on the top right corner of Navigation Bar. After that click on "New repository" from the drop down options.
            <p>Write a name for your repository and give brief description. Add a README file and click on "Create repository" button.</p>
            <p>A new repository will be created.</p>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step-3: Clone the repository</h3>
        <p>Create a new file on the system. Open Command Prompt with the path of the folder in which we are storing our file in.
        <p>Copy the link of the repository by click on the "code"after opening the repository on GitHub. After that write </p>
        <p>"git clone <hhh>[our repository link]</hhh> "</p>
        <p>on Command Prompt. </p>
        <p>By doing this we are copying our GitHub repository to our local system.</p>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Step-4: Add file in repository</h3>
        <p>Move the newly created file in the repository folder, on our systems. After that write
            <p>"git add <hhh>[our file name]</hhh>"</p>
            <p>on Command Prompt. </p>
            <p>By doing this git selects that file, and moves it to the staging area, marking it for inclusion in the next commit. We can select all files, a directory, specific files, or even specific parts of a file for staging and commit. This means if we git add a deleted file the deletion is staged for commit.</p>
